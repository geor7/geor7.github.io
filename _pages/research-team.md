# Research Team
## Collaborations
I welcome collaborations on research related to AI applications in business and operations management, including (but not limited to) natural language processing (NLP), applied machine learning, and data-driven approaches to OSCM and business topics. 

If you are interested in potential research collaboration, please feel free to get in touch via email with a brief outline of your research interests.

## PhD Supervision and Scholarships
I am happy to discuss potential PhD projects aligned with my research areas, particularly in AI-driven operations and supply chain management, digital transformation, and technology-enabled business analytics. I primarily employ quantitative methods, including econometrics, survey-based research, and applied machine learning.
