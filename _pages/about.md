# 😀 about me 
<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I focus on developing and applying arificial intelligence models to enhance operations and supply chain management. 
I am currently an assistant professor at University of Sussex Business School (USBS). Also, I am an visiting research fellow at Leeds University Business School (LUBS).
I obtained my PhD degree at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (<a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk">HKPolyU</a>) and completed AI course and projects at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (<a href="https://hkust.edu.hk">HKUST</a>).
During my master studies at Macau University of Science and Technology, I worked on projects related to supply chain relationship.

I am particularly interested in sustainable operations management, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning applications, healthcare operations, fashion business and supply chain, supply chain innovation, etc.
