[From corporate environmental responsibility to purchase intention of Chinese buyers: The mediation role of relationship quality](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cb.1857)

<!-- [**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->
- **Journal of Consumer Behaviour. 2021**.
- **Methodology Feature:** Survey methodology using primary data.
- Deteriorating environmental conditions and frequent environmental incidents have urged corporations' execution on corporate environmental responsibility (CER). For maintaining a positive CER, buyers have considered the performance of their suppliers' CER when the buyers plan to sign or renew a contract with their suppliers. However, it is still under-examined how the mechanism works between supplier CER and buyer repurchase intention (BRPI). This study explores the mediating effects of relationship quality between supplier CER and BRPI.
